# Project Goals:

* Use fastest STT (Speech to text) / TTS (Text to Speech API) **[Currently using OpenAI Deepgram]**
* Use fastest audio recording library. 
* Use a wake word, "Hey, Jarvis."
* Response generated by OpenAI ChatGPT (tokenized to behave like Jarvis)

## Virual Environment Setup For Testing

```pip install virtualenv```

```
# TO CREATE VENV
virtualenv <name>
```

```
# TO ACTVATE VENV
. .\<name>\Scripts\activate
```

```
# TO DEACTIVATE VENV
deactivate
```

## Temporary TTS Solution

```
pip install pyttsx3
```

## Current TTS Solution

```
```

## Deepgram

* [Deepgram Github](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-python-sdk)

```
pip install deepgram-sdk
```
